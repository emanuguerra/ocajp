Notes OCAJP

## Java building blocks

A wildcard used in an import statement means to import all classes included in the package.

The \* wildcard doesn't import **included sub packages**.

In import statements, you can only use wildcard when it is the last character of the statement (before the semicolon).

Java lang package doesn't need to be imported.

Numeric literals are allowed to begin with 0 :

* 0 for octal
* 0x or 0X  for hexadecimal
* 0b or 0B for binary

Identifiers may contain letters, numbers, $ and _ signs.

Identifier should not start with a number.
